      <p>We are a duo IDM band currenly located in Montreal.</p>

      <p>
        It's rainfallish techno beats coupled with funky synth slowly
        transforming into trippy dream hop just to give way to airy piano
        passages and drone harmonies...
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, less words, more woods! <Link to="/music/">Listen</Link>
        <span> </span>
        and hope you enjoy.
